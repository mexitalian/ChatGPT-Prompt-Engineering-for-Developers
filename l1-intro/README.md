## Why
Understanding ChatGPT prompt engineering empowers developers to leverage LLMs effectively, unlocking innovative applications and enhancing productivity in software development.

## How
The course teaches best practices for using instruction-tuned LLMs, emphasizing clarity in instructions and allowing the model time to process requests for optimal results.

## What
The lesson covers prompting techniques, common use cases, and practical applications, including building a chatbot, to inspire creativity in software development.

## Cheatsheet
- **Use instruction-tuned LLMs**
  - **Reasoning:** They are designed to follow instructions better than base LLMs.
  - **Example:** "For most practical applications today, we would recommend most people instead focus on instruction-tuned LLMs."

- **Be clear and specific in prompts**
  - **Reasoning:** Clear instructions help the LLM generate desired outputs.
  - **Example:** "If you specify what you want the tone of the text to be, it helps the LLM generate what you want."

- **Give the LLM time to think**
  - **Reasoning:** Allowing processing time can lead to more thoughtful and accurate responses.
  - **Example:** "Giving the LLM time to think is an important principle of prompting."

- **Specify context and tone**
  - **Reasoning:** Contextual details guide the LLM in producing relevant content.
  - **Example:** "Should it take on the tone like a professional journalist would write?"

- **Provide background information**
  - **Reasoning:** Supplying relevant snippets can enhance the LLM's understanding of the task.
  - **Example:** "If you can specify what snippets of text they should read in advance, that sets up success."

## Quotes
- "The power of LLMs as a developer tool is still very underappreciated."
- "Think of giving instructions to another person, say someone that's smart but doesn’t know the specifics of your task."
