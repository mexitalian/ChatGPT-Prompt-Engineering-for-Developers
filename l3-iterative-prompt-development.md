# Prompt Development Process

**Why:** Developing effective prompts is an iterative process, focusing on refining ideas rather than achieving perfection on the first try.

**How:** 
1. Start with an idea
2. Write a prompt
3. Run it
4. Analyze the result
5. Refine the prompt based on feedback
6. Iterate until achieving the desired outcome

**What:** The lesson demonstrates the process of developing prompts for applications using large language models, emphasizing the importance of clarity, specificity, and iteration in prompt engineering.

## Cheatsheet:
- Start with an idea for the task you want to achieve.
  - *Reasoning:* Clear objectives lead to focused prompts.
  - *Example:* Define the goal of summarizing a fact sheet for a chair.
- Write a clear and specific prompt.
  - *Reasoning:* Specific instructions guide the model effectively.
  - *Example:* Task the model with creating a product description based on the fact sheet.
- Analyze the result and refine the prompt iteratively.
  - *Reasoning:* Feedback helps improve the prompt for better outcomes.
  - *Example:* Adjust the prompt to limit the word count for a more concise description.

## Quotes:
- "Developing a prompt is an iterative process."
- "The key to being an effective prompt engineer is having a good process."
- "Prompts are effective when they are tailored to your application."
