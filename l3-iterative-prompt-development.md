# Prompt Development for Machine Learning Models

**Why:** Developing effective prompts for machine learning models is an iterative process that requires refining ideas and instructions to achieve desired results for specific applications.

**How:** Start by writing a prompt based on your idea, run it, analyze the output, and iterate by clarifying instructions or giving more guidance to the model until you reach a satisfactory result.

**What:** The lesson demonstrates the process of developing a prompt for summarizing a fact sheet, showing how to refine the prompt to control the length, focus on specific details, and include additional instructions for better results.

## Cheatsheet:
- Write a prompt based on your idea
  - **Reasoning:** Provides initial guidance for the model
  - **Example:** "Your task is to help a marketing team create a description for a retail website based on a fact sheet."
- Analyze the output and refine the prompt
  - **Reasoning:** Allows for adjustments based on the initial results
  - **Example:** "Clarify the prompt to limit the output to at most 50 words."
- Iterate by modifying the prompt for specific requirements
  - **Reasoning:** Tailors the prompt to achieve desired outcomes
  - **Example:** "Include specific product IDs in the description for furniture retailers."
