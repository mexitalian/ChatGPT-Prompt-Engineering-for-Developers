# Prompt Development Process

**Why:** Developing effective prompts is an iterative process, focusing on refining ideas rather than achieving perfection on the first try.

**How:** 
1. Start with an idea
2. Write a prompt
3. Run it
4. Analyze the result
5. Refine the prompt based on feedback
6. Iterate until it meets the application's needs

**What:** The lesson demonstrates the process of developing prompts for applications using large language models, emphasizing the importance of iteration and refinement.

## Cheatsheet:
- Start with an idea for the task you want to achieve.
  - **Reasoning:** Provides a clear goal for prompt development.
  - **Example:** Summarizing a fact sheet for a chair.
- Write a clear and specific prompt, run it, and analyze the output.
  - **Reasoning:** Allows for evaluation and refinement.
  - **Example:** Creating a product description for a retail website.
- Refine the prompt based on feedback, adjust instructions as needed, and iterate until the desired result is achieved.
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures the prompt aligns with the application's requirements.
  - **Example:** Modifying the prompt to focus on technical details for furniture retailers.
