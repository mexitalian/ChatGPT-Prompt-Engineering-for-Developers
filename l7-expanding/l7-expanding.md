## Why
Understanding how to expand text using AI enhances communication and creativity, allowing for personalized interactions that can improve customer satisfaction.

## How
By utilizing a language model's capabilities, users can generate tailored responses based on sentiment analysis, ensuring appropriate and effective communication.

## What
The lesson covers setting up the OpenAI Python package, defining functions, and using parameters like "temperature" to control response variability in generated text.

## Cheatsheet
- **Set up OpenAI Python package**
  - **Reason:** Necessary for accessing language model functionalities.
  - **Example:** Install with `pip install openai`.

- **Define helper function "get_completion"**
  - **Reason:** Streamlines the process of generating text responses.
  - **Example:** `def get_completion(prompt): return openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)`.

- **Generate a custom email response**
  - **Reason:** Personalizes communication based on customer feedback.
  - **Example:** Use sentiment analysis to tailor responses to positive or negative reviews.

- **Use "temperature" parameter to vary responses**
  - **Reason:** Controls the randomness and creativity of the model's output.
  - **Example:** Set temperature to 0 for predictable responses, or 0.7 for varied outputs.

- **Test different temperatures for output variation**
  - **Reason:** Helps understand how temperature affects creativity in responses.
  - **Example:** Experiment with prompts at various temperatures to see differences.
